To log in, the user clicks on the upper right corner. If the user does not have an account, he or she can click at the register button next to the log in or click in "create one" at the login page.\\

On the other side, the seller receives a notification when he or she is contacted\footnote{The notification is shown with a red dot on the user icon. A message appears on hover} and needs to confirm the proposal.\\

\end{center}

Before being contacted, the seller had to add a book to sell. This is done by clicking on "Vender" button on the header or clicking on the upper right corner after logging in, which sends the user to his or her dashboard.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=300pt]{img/mockups/Huascar Retrieval Team - Copy of Dashboard.jpg}
\end{center}

Since every user can be a seller and a buyer, the dashboard contains this three options. If the user hasn't sold or bought a book, a message with a "No hay libros disponibles" is displayed instead of an empty space.

If a book is clicked on the seller tab on the dashboard, a page like the following is displayed. If a book is pressed in the buyers tab, the pages presented below appear depending on the stage of the purchase.

\end{center}

The next pages show the process to buy a book from the buyer's (Fulanito on the upper right corner) and seller's (Menganito on the upper right corner) perspective.

On the third stage, "En camino", the buyer is first presented with a first line of "Tu libro está en camino" and the seller with input boxes for a delivery address (in case it is being send by delivery and not meeting point) and additional information if needed (ex: tracking code of the package). Only after the seller confirms the delivery, the buyer gets the address where the package is or will be send and the additional information entered by the seller. The option of "change address" is also presented to the buyer, which sends a notification to the seller and can change the address if possible.

Before sending the book, both the seller and buyer have the "cancel" option. Because this is a destructive action, the following pop up is presented when trying to cancel. The same logic applies when the buyer cancels.
